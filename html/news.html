                                    W3C's Web Accessibility Initiative will be hosting an Accessible E-Learning online symposium on December 16, 2013. They are currently inviting submission of new research, ongoing research, and analysis of past research related to e-learning accessibility. Learning and education are the enablers of social and economic change. E-learning systems allow instructors and students to interact synchronously and asynchronously from any part of the world that has a viable internet connection. This symposium will explore the relationship between content accessibility and interface accessibility, accessibility of e-learning environments used in non-conventional contexts, privacy issues in profiling learners and e-learning environments users, and other important topics. Participation in the symposium is free. For more information about the symposium, including submission guidelines and partipation information, see http://www.w3.org/WAI/RD/2013/e-learning/
