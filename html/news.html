                            W3C's Web Accessibility Initiative will be hosting an Accessible E-Learning online symposium on December 16, 2013. They are currently inviting submission of new research, ongoing research, and analysis of past research related to e-learning accessibility. Learning and education are the enablers of social and economic change. E-learning systems allow instructors and students to interact synchronously and asynchronously from any part of the world that has a viable internet connection. This symposium will explore the relationship between content accessibility and interface accessibility, accessibility of e-learning environments used in non-conventional contexts, privacy issues in profiling learners and e-learning environments users, and other important topics. Participation in the symposium is free. For more information about the symposium, including submission guidelines and partipation information, see http://www.w3.org/WAI/RD/2013/e-learning/

The webinar, entitled "Outside In - Achieving Our Goals by Designing for Diversity," will discuss how processes that design open courseware resources and delivery platforms for diverse learners also address many other goals, including deeper learning, delivery on mobile platforms, discovery, internationalization, and many more.
