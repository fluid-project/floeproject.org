                            <p>FLOE provides the resources to personalize how we each learn and to address barriers to learning.
                                Learners learn differently, and todayâ€™s society needs diverse, self-aware, life-long learners.
                                FLOE supports learners, educators and curriculum producers in achieving one-size-fits-one learning design
                                for the full diversity of learners, leveraging the variants made possible by

                        <p>Being able to transform, augment, and select alternative educational resources to fit individual needs is essential for
                            an inclusive learning experience. Open Educational Resources (OERs) are free and open for use and reuse in teaching,
                            learning and research. The OER ecosystem can provide an ever-increasing pool of alternative ways to learn.
                            FLOE helps to build knowledge about what works best for each learner.</p>
