<p>
As part of an effort to include diverse perspectives in the creation of inclusive
cities, the IDRC and Floe organized co-design sessions in elementary and
middle schools with students in Grades 3, 5, and 6. The co-design activity was developed
in collaboration with classroom teachers and parents to tailor the activity to
the interests and needs of the children. A

was created which includes instructions for several city design activities.
</p>
<p>
The design process included giving students blank cards to add their own features
to their neighbourhood which resulted in the inclusion of religious centres, airports,
banks, gyms, and stadiums. The overarching themes that emerged from the co-design
sessions show that environmental friendliness, accessibility, and inclusivity of
neighbourhoods were important factors for students in all three grades.
