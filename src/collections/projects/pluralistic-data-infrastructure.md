The [pluralistic data infrastructure](https://github.com/inclusive-design/forgiving-data/) allows learners to combine
different personal data sources to create representations that can lead to self-discovery and new pathways for learning.
“COVID-19 Vaccination Centre Data Monitor: Accessibility Map Demonstration” is an example how multiple sources of data
can be used to generate new insights.
