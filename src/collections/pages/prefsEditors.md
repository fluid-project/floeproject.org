title: Preference Editing Tools
---

The Floe Project is collaborating with the [Global Public Inclusive Infrastructure](http://gpii.net) to build tools to
allow users to create personalized digital interfaces. These preference management tools enable and promote the
discovery, adjustment and application of user preferences across multiple devices. A user will be able to customize any
interface they might encounter by exploring and then declaring preferences, saving them to the cloud, and applying them
to devices (both private and public). For example, a user may use these tools to discover and adjust their preferences
on a personal laptop, and later apply these preferences to a public ticketing kiosk.

Personalized interfaces have the potential to help digital users overcome barriers to access and participation in an
increasingly digital world. Interfaces that meet users where they are, adapt to their unique needs, and empower them to
participate by putting the personalization decisions in their hands are not only possible, but are a necessity for many
to “get in the digital door.” The goal of this personalization is to make interaction with technology as painless and as
enjoyable as possible for all.
