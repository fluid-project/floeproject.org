The FLOE project (Flexible Learning for Open Education) engages diverse learners and educators to design more inclusive
forms of teaching and learning.

Learning happens best when the experience is personalized to individual needs. Open Educational Resources (OER) that are
open to use and adapt, provide an opportunity to meet the diverse needs of learners, including those with disabilities.
The FLOE Project supports the OER community in providing a sustainable, integrated approach to accessible learning,
addressing the needs of learners who currently face barriers.

The FLOE project develops and gathers strategies and techniques that can be used for inclusive learning and teaching.
These are shared through a variety of open guides and toolkits including:

* the [Community-Led Co-design Kit](https://co-design.inclusivedesign.ca/),
* the [Inclusive Learning Design Handbook](https://handbook.floeproject.org/followaccessibilityprinciples),
* the [Inclusive Design Guide](https://guide.inclusivedesign.ca/), and
* [SNOW](https://snow.idrc.ocadu.ca/).

These guides and kits support the FLOE project’s growing ecosystem of inclusive learning and teaching tools that aim to
transform, augment, and personalize the learning experience.

FLOE has been contributing to the [Fluid Infusion Framework](https://fluidproject.org/infusion.html) which provides a
technical infrastructure that can be used to create tools that are flexible and transformable. One example of such a
tool can be seen in the “show preferences” panel at the top of this site. This tool can be implemented into any website
and allows a learner to transform web content to meet their personal needs and preferences. More information can be
found on the [UI Options](/ui-options) page.

FLOE contributes to many efforts in open education including:

* the [Weavly coding environment](https://create.weavly.org/?v=1.0&t=mixed&w=Space&p=&c=abb&a=123456ABDabd),
* the [Inverted Wordles](https://wecount.inclusivedesign.ca/views/inverted-wordles/) tool,
* the [Coding Educator’s Toolkit](https://weavly.org/learn/),
* [AI Education Badges](https://wecount.inclusivedesign.ca/badges/), and
* the [Open Robot Kit](https://www.codelearncreate.org/blog/open-robot-kit/)

The FLOE project is integral to the Fluid open community, a global community of people with varied lived experience
including designers and developers, who provide support and advice for anyone working on learning content and tools.

FLOE is a project of the [Inclusive Design Research Centre](https://idrc.ocadu.ca/), [OCAD University](https://ocadu.ca/).

Funded by a grant from [The William and Flora Hewlett Foundation](https://hewlett.org/).
