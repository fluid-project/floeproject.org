<time datetime="2015-02-25">February 25</time> - <time datetime="2015-02-27">27, 2015</time>
IDRC at OCAD University, Toronto, ON

The Inclusive Design Research Centre (IDRC) at OCAD University will be hosting an OER Accessibility Sprint. Experts in
the field of Open Educational Resources (OER) will gather to design and develop tools and exemplars that make practical
progress in the important agenda of inclusive learning through OER.

## About

In this moment we have a tremendous challenge and opportunity to leap forward in the accessibility of interactive
resources. HTML5 and EPUB3 development is gaining popularity. Development tools and authoring environments are being
created, component toolkits are being populated. The timing is critical, we need to make an impact before the
conventions lock in. We can help to ensure that all learners can participate in experiential, game-based, problem-based
learning and that students using alternative access means can benefit from the innovative advances in open textbooks.

We hope you will join us for two days of collaboration, great food and drink, and real progress on important topics.
Among the challenges on the agenda are a special focus on HTML5 and EPUB3 applied in:

* simulations and highly interactive content,
* video and timed media,
* gaming,
* mobile and responsive content, and
* OER delivery platforms.

We need coders but we also need designers, educators, policy makers, experts in addressing accessibility barriers,
problem solvers and people willing to assist in any way they can. At the IDRC we have proven time and again that the
more diverse the perspectives, knowledge and skills, the better the collective outcomes.
