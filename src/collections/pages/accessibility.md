The FLOE website has been created and tested to meet accessibility preferences and needs, and complies with WCAG and
web standards to help ensure consistent and expected behaviour across different technologies and user agents.

Below is a list of some of the features embedded in the FLOE website. If you encounter a problem accessing
floeproject.org or would like to provide feedback, please [file an issue on Github](https://github.com/fluid-project/floeproject.org/issues/new/choose)
or email [idrc@ocadu.ca](mailto:idrc@ocadu.ca).

To access the settings select “show preferences” at the top right of any page.
* compatibility with screen reading software and can be navigated using a keyboard or other assistive technology.
* alternative text for images and other graphical content.
* use of simple language where possible.
