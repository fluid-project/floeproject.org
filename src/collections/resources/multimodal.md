Digital design offers diverse possibilities for transformation and adaptation of learning content. How do we leverage
these possibilities in envisioning, building and evolving tools for learning to support diverse learning needs?

* [User Interface Options Video (2017)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63DqNgxtsrA")
  Learn about the Fluid Project's User Interface Options (UIO) component, how it enables people to personalise web
  content to meet their unique needs, and how to integrate it into a site. UIO is now available as a
  [Chrome browser extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ui-options-plus-uio%2B/okenndailhmikjjfcnmolpaefecbpaek)
  enabling the web browser to transform web pages directly.
* [Multimodal Design Patterns for Inclusion &amp; Accessibility](http://www.alanharnum.ca/post/2017-06-01-multimodal-design-for-inclusion/)
  A presentation from the 2017 University of Guelph Accessibility Conference discussing multimodality as a tool for
  building inclusive experiences and shifting perceptions.
* [Nexus Science Lab Video (2017)](https://youtu.be/NNwc0VYRhUU)
  See how sensors commonly found in a science lab can be connected to accessible, sonified graphs using the
  [Nexus, a system that connects disparate technologies](https://wiki.gpii.net/w/Nexus_API), enabling new and inclusive
  interactions that can be used to visualize and sonify data as it is gathered.
* [Nexus Inclusive Music Creation Video (2016)](https://youtu.be/7R_pz2Fz4qE)
  See a demonstration of the Nexus being used to inclusively create music using various inputs including a head tracker.
* [Sonification](https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/%28Floe%29+Sonification) is the audio representation of
  data. Try the [inclusive chart authoring tool](https://build.fluidproject.org/chartAuthoring/demos/) that automatically
  sonifies data using the sonification framework that provides a set of tools to help web developers more easily create
  sound-based representations of interactive data.
* [Harmonious Authorship from Different Representations (2015)](https://ppig.org/papers/2015-ppig-26th-basman/) is a
  paper that describes the Infusion system which brings together different users engaged in different tasks at
  different times, and allow them shared authorial access to the same artefacts which are presented to each in a
  notation appropriate for them.
* [Creating a Global Public Inclusive Infrastructure (2011)](https://gpii.net/sites/gpii.net/files/uploads/attachments/node/44/2011_aegis-creating_a_global_public_inclusive_infrastructure-final.doc)
  is a document that describes the Global Public Inclusive Infrastructure (GPII). The GPII aims to ensure that everyone
  who faces accessibility barrier due to disability, literacy or aging, regardless of economic resources, can access and
  use the Internet and all its information, communities, and services for education, employment, daily living, civic
  participation, health and safety.
* [First Discovery](https://build.fluidproject.org/first-discovery/demos/) is a tool that guides people through a step
  by step process of discovering, declaring and storing digital preferences.
* [Discovery Cats](https://build-discoverycat.fluidproject.org/demo/)
  Play the Discovery Cats game, and [see some playful designs](https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Discovery+Cats+-+First+Discovery)
  for setting user preferences and check out the [student project](https://github.com/fluid-lab/Discovery-Cat) that
  turned this into a game.
