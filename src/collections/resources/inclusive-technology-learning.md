Articles on the possibilities of inclusive learning technologies, and selected examples.

* [Interactive Simulations for Science and Math](https://phet.colorado.edu/en/accessibility/prototypes)
  Play with PhET’s fun, free, interactive, research-based science and mathematics simulations. Some simulations (like
  [John Travoltage](https://phet.colorado.edu/sims/html/john-travoltage/latest/john-travoltage_en.html)) support
  increased accessibility features like keyboard controls, accessible descriptions and audio representation of data
  through sonification.
* [SNOW - Access to education using technology](https://snow.idrc.ocadu.ca/)
  Get information and training geared to educators, parents and students with disabilities on technologies for learning
  both in and out of the classroom.
* [Clusive Reader](https://clusive.cast.org/) supports learners through personalization of content, a vocabulary
builder, read-aloud and more. Clusive Reader is a project by [Center on Inclusive Software for Learning (CISL)](http://cisl.cast.org/).
* [Work in Progress Report: Nonvisual Visual Programming(2014)](https://ppig.org/papers/2014-ppig-25th-lewis/) - a
paper that discusses the accessibility barriers of teaching visual programming systems, and exploration of a nonvisual
programming environment.
* [Georgia Tech Sonification Lab](https://www.gvu.gatech.edu/research/labs/sonification-lab) focuses on human
interactions through sound, auditory displays, and other complex tasks and environments.
* [Work in Progress: A Nonvisual Interface for a Blocks Language (2016)](https://ppig.org/papers/2016-ppig-27th-koushik/)-
A paper that explores approaches to make learning and teaching of programming systems accessible to non-visual learners.

videos in multiple languages.
* [Pressbooks](https://pressbooks.com/) is an easy-to-use book authoring software enables people to create books in
multiple formats for online and print publishing.
* [Interoperability for Individual Learner Centred Accessibility for Web-based Educational Systems (2006)](http://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/jeductechsoci.9.4.215.pdf)
  This paper describes the AccessForAll accessibility strategy for delivering accessible computer based resources to
  individual learners based on their specified needs and preferences in the circumstances in which they are operating.
  The FLOE project is based on this original work.
