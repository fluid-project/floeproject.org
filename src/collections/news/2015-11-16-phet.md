Floe is working with [PhET](https://phet.colorado.edu/) to improve the accessibility of their free, open, interactive
physics simulations. Over the past year, we have contributed research, ideas, and evaluations for improvements to two of
PhET's simulations: [Forces and Motion Basics](https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/PhET+Forces+and+Motion+Simulation+Design)
and [John Travoltage](https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/PhET+John+Travoltage+Simulation+Design).

The PhET team has been working to incorporate our input into a development version of the
[Forces and Motion: Basics](https://phet.colorado.edu/en/simulations/forces-and-motion-basics) simulation, and is now
conducting user tests. Implementation of the new designs for the John Travoltage simulation is planned for
<time datetime="2015-12">December 2015</time>.

From this collaboration with PhET, a guide
"[Web Games and Simulations](https://handbook.floeproject.org/approaches/web-games-and-simulations/)" has been added to the
[Inclusive Learning Design Handbook](https://handbook.floeproject.org/) to help educators create more inclusive and
accessible web games and educational simulations.
