The PhET project recently published the [Resistance in a Wire (RIAW)](https://phet.colorado.edu/en/simulations/resistance-in-a-wire)
simulation, complete with sound, description, and alternative input. This simulation, along with the
[Ohm’s Law](https://phet.colorado.edu/en/simulations/ohms-law) simulation, has served as a primary teacher over the past
two years, guiding towards deep understanding of effective design and development of sounds and description for
simulations. There were a record number of release candidates created for this sim, and many hours of dedicated effort
by the QA team to bring an accessible version of RIAW to the world.

Initial design discussions about the simulation started in <time datetime="2017-07">July 2017</time> and worked to
answer the following questions:

* How do we effectively cue a change in one variable, while interacting with a second variable?
* How do students interpret increasing a slider value, while hearing a decrease in another variable?
* Do we need to layer two sounds? If so, what qualities of sounds help us convey that we’re
  increasing/decreasing one value while a corresponding value is simultaneously increasing/decreasing?
* What types of sound support cueing mentioned above, and work equally well when interaction can be done
  continuously (e.g., when using a continuous slider with a mouse) and in discrete steps (e.g., when using
  a continuous slider incrementally with keyboard)?

From <time datetime="2017-09">September 2017</time> through to <time datetime="2018-05">May 2018</time> over 100
learners were interviewed and/or surveyed regarding their use of this simulation in its many iterations. The information
gathered through these interviews was used to inform the development of the simulation resulting in making it accessible
to many learners with disabilities, using elegant visual, auditory, and interaction design.
