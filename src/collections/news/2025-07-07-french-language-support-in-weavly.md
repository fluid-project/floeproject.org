Weavly now supports French, making the application more accessible to French speaking users. With this update, every button, label, heading, and announcement are fully localized in French. This enhancement ensures a more inclusive and user friendly experience for those who prefer to interact with the platform in French.

Check out the official announcement on [Coding to Learn and Create](https://codelearncreate.org/blog/french-support/) website, or try [Weavly](https://create.weavly.org/) in French.
