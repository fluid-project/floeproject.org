[Lumen Learning](https://lumenlearning.com/) has been selected to receive funding as part of the
[Next Generation Courseware Challenge](https://www.gatesfoundation.org/Ideas/Media-Center/Press-Releases/2014/09/Gates-Foundation-Announces-Finalists-for-$20-Million-in-Digital-Courseware-Investments),
a $20 million grant competition from the [Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation](https://www.gatesfoundation.org/) to build
exemplary, affordable digital course materials that improve student success among low-income and disadvantaged learners.
Inspired in part by the groundbreaking work of Benjamin Bloom, Lumen’s courseware will apply educational strategies that
show promise for improving learning outcomes: personal learning pathways for developing subject mastery; personalized
teaching; and effective use of open educational resources. The result will be “next generation” courseware for four
introductory-level college courses that enroll millions of students every year: Introduction to Business; Principles of
Marketing; Microeconomics; and Macroeconomics.

The Floe team is excited to be a partner in this project. Floe will design the courseware’s universally accessible user
experience through a highly iterative, inclusive and learner-centric process. The courseware developed through this
grant will pioneer a new model for digital courseware and delivery tailored to the needs of disadvantaged students.
