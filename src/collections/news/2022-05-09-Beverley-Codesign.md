From March 24th to May 2nd, 2022, a series of co-design sessions were held at an
elementary school in the Greater Toronto Area that specializes in working with
students with intellectual and physical disabilities.

Four classes with students in different age groups participated in learning basic
directions while trying the [Weavly coding environment](https://create.weavly.org/).
Intermediate Level students worked with more complex concepts such as loops.

The codesign resulted in many new improvements for Weavly as well as improvements to the
[facilitators guides in the Weavly Educator's Toolkit](https://weavly.org/learn/resources/page/2/).
More [detailed information about the codesign](https://www.codelearncreate.org/blog/beverley-codesign/) 
can be found on the Coding to Learn and Create website.
