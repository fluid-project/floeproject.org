excerpt: Crossroads, an interactive and educational game
---

The Floe team recently had the opportunity to engage with Crossroads, an interactive and educational game developed through the AMES project. The game explores themes of migration, identity, and decision-making through immersive storytelling and gameplay. Our team at the IDRC has been supporting efforts to make the game more accessible to a wider range of players.

During the session, we had the chance to play through key segments of the game and provide direct feedback on how the recent changes are working in practice.
