excerpt: Design crit in collaboration with PhET Interactive Simulations
---

The Floe team recently held a design crit in collaboration with PhET Interactive Simulations to work on designing the accessible interactions for the [Number Pairs interactive simulation](https://phet.colorado.edu/en/simulations/number-pairs). This simulation is focused on decomposing a number into two addends, and putting two addends together to create a total for the number. Itâ€™s aimed at early math learners ages 4-7. One design challenge we explored was how to make accessible movable objects that also have the ability to change color on demand.
