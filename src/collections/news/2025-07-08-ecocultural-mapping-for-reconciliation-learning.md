The [Ecocultural Mapping project](https://floeproject.org/projects/ecocultural-mapping/ "https://floeproject.org/projects/ecocultural-mapping/") was presented at the [CSBA Congress and National Trustee Gathering on Indigenous Education](https://www.mbschoolboards.ca/about/csba-congress-2025/ "https://www.mbschoolboards.ca/about/csba-congress-2025/") (July 3-4, 2025) in a workshop titled **Mapping Stories, Healing Lands: Ecocultrual Mapping for Reconciliation & Learning.**

This session was aimed at supporting elected public school board members in Canada to develop and enrich Indigenous education, and to activate reconciliation through integrating ecocultural mapping into curricula. The workshop focused on how policy can foster land-based learning and partnerships with Indigenous communities, promoting culturally responsive education.

In this workshop participants learned how ecocultural mapping integrates Indigenous knowledge and Western science to support language revitalization, environmental stewardship, and culturally responsive education. Participants learned how digital story mapping can enhance curricula, promote reconciliation, and engage students in place-based learning.

The workshop was led by school board trustee member Jeannine Georgeson (hailing from the Gulf Islands School District of British Columbia) along with Dana Ayotte (IDRC, IMERSS), and Kusemaat Shirley Williams (Whiteswan Environmental) from the Lummi Territory in north-western Washington State.
