Erasing Imaginary Lines, Healing the Land was an exhibit that took place at the Yellowhouse Art Centre on Galiano
Island, BC, from October 5-27, 2024. It presented the work of the [Xetthecum digital ecocultural storymap](/ecocultural-mapping-project/),
an intergenerational, cross-cultural and community-led project focused on creating an ecocultural storymap of an area
known as Xetthecum in the Hul’q’umi’num’ language (Retreat Cove, Galiano Island). The exhibit also featured projects
that are related to or that inspired the Xetthecum project, including species maps of Galiano Island created by local
artists, an overview of [Whiteswan Environmental](https://www.whiteswanenvironmental.org/)’s work, and a
[digital project gallery](https://imerss.github.io/xetthecum-storymap/files/inspiring_projects.html). A Coast Salish
loom was set up in the middle of the space, inviting visitors to do some weaving and providing a cultural, visual and
physical gathering point for the exhibit.

A large timeline was created for the exhibit, telling the story of the project from its inception in 2020 to the
present. The meandering timeline, with thought-bubble questions appearing along its path, reflects the emergent and
exploratory nature of the project. To learn more please visit the exhibit

    2020 at the start and 2024 at the end, and labelled with the increasingly longer spans of Phase I, Phase II and
    Phase III along the bottom of the banner. Various text boxes with images appear across the banner describing
    different aspects and phases of the project. Thought bubbles with questions also appear along the timeline.  Figures
    are drawn to the left of the bannner, indicating scale. A title appears above the bannner: tth'i'wum nuw'ilum 'i'
