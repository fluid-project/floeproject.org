FLOE is working with the [Coding to Learn and Create project](https://codelearncreate.ca/) to design educational coding
tools for kids who've been left out of learning, and to create Open Educational Resources (OER) including activities,
lessons, and projects that help kids learn, develop social and communication skills, and express themselves with code.

We've created a [coding prototype](https://prototype.codelearncreate.org/) for learners to try out. The prototype works
with robots that are currently being used in classrooms to teach programming skills.
