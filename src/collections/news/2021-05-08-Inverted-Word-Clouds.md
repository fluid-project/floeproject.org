    In a traditional word cloud, the most popular answers are emphasized. With Inverted Word Clouds,
    we are exploring ways to invert that relationship and amplify minority voices.

In a traditional word cloud, the most popular answers (e.g. words, phrases) are emphasized. The result of
this emphasis is for the minority to fade away into the background. We are building an Inverted Word Cloud
tool, that inverts this relationship and provides a means to amplify minority voices.

                In this Inverted Word Cloud, the minority answers are emphasised, appearing larger, while the
                majority responses appear smaller. For example "formative feedback" and "differentiation in design"
                appear more prominently; where as, "open" and "safety" appear smaller. Visually all of the words are
                arranged at different angles and appear in different colours. However, the most salient dimension is
                the size of the font the words are displayed in. It's also worth noting that some of the de-emphasized
                words are sufficiently small that they are unreadable. If there was no option to invert the word
                cloud, these ideas would be lost.
