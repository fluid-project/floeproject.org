excerpt: Exploring possibilities for easy to create ‘one-size-fits-one’ robots.

Off the shelf robots are often inaccessible for many learners.
[The Open Robot Kit](https://weavly.org/open-robot-kit/)
seeks to enable learners and educators to easily create a ‘one-size-fits-one’ robot
that works with the
[Weavly](https://create.weavly.org/)
coding environment.

After initial design and prototype work by
[Tetra TMU](https://ca.linkedin.com/company/tetratmu)
students, the Floe team continued to iterate on the Tetra TMU Art Bot, focusing on a
dual motor design. During these iterations, two microcontroller platforms, multiple
DC motors and multiple chassis were tested.

Using the available motors, the robot can move in the general direction requested,
however the movement isn’t exact and currently causes too much confusion for students.
See the

project page for more details, next steps and to get involved.
