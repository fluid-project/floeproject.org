We are excited to launch [Inclusive Standards](https://standards.inclusivedesign.ca/), a new project hub from the Inclusive Design Research Centre (IDRC). This website brings together our work related to making standards more inclusive ranging from conducting research with the disability community to inform standards development, drafting seed standards, actively participating in standards development committees, and improving the standardization process to include Disabled and Deaf people. 

Many standards have overlooked the perspectives of disabled people and other marginalized communities. To overcome these issues, the IDRC has been working on accessibility and inclusive standards development for over 30 years. Our involvement has expanded across local and global efforts, from informing the development of the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act (AODA) to contributing to international standards through bodies like ISO and IMS Global. More recently, our focus has turned toward supporting standards development under the Accessible Canada Act, as well as emerging work in Europe. 

This long standing commitment is now reflected in the new Inclusive Standards project hub. Check out the [Inclusive Standards Resources](https://standards.inclusivedesign.ca/resources/) to see a growing collection of open resources related to inclusive standards.
