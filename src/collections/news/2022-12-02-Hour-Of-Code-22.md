The Floe project is participating in [Hour of Code 2022](https://hourofcode.com/ca/learn).
Hour of Code is a worldwide initiative with the goal of broadening participation in the
field of computer science. This year, more of the participating organizations provided
basic accessibility in their activities. While this is an excellent start, we went beyond
this to include kids with complex disabilities who are almost always left out of
coding education.

Two new activities were added to Weavly's educator toolkit for the event. Both the
[Drawing Shapes Activity](https://weavly.org/learn/activities/drawing-shapes/) and the
[Creating Patterns Activity](https://weavly.org/learn/activities/creating-patterns/) use
the [Weavly coding environment](https://create.weavly.org) as a virtual drawing canvas.
The activities helps learners identify cause and effect, use directional navigation
and embrace their creativity.
