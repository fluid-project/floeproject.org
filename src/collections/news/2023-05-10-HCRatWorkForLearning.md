From April 30 to May 3, members from the Inclusive Design Research Centre
attended the Human Computer Relationships @Work for Learning convening hosted by
[PhET at the University of Boulder Colorado](https://phet.colorado.edu/) with
funding from NSF. Researchers and experts from the fields of inclusive design,
embodied cognition, and haptics from around the world gathered to share ideas,
discuss challenges, and collaborate on new approaches bringing together insights
from their respective fields.

The IDRC shared methods of incorporating inclusive design practices for
research and design for learning, ideas for building designs with intentional
and fortuitous flexibility, and opportunities and hazards of artificial
intelligence.

The IDRC hopes to invite attendees from this convening to future
[community workshops and design crits](https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Community+workshops+and+design+crits)
to continue building relationships and advance collaborations.
