We Count is [gathering challenges](https://wecount.inclusivedesign.ca/inclusion-challenges/) faced by the community
related to data ecosystem inclusion.

In two co-creation activities, We Count engaged diverse perspectives to consider the needs and requirements for a more
equitable Smart City. Stories were co-created to uncover and explain challenges, needs, benefits and potential dangers
of data-driven communities. The [resulting reports](https://wecount.inclusivedesign.ca/views/journeys-through-the-digital-innovation-appendix-of-the-master-innovation-and-development-plan/)
are openly available.

                An illustrator provided a visual representation of these stories, specifically what can happen when
                decisions are based on audio sensor data that canâ€™t recognize uncontrollable noises such as involuntary
                vocalizations.

                An image showing a homeowner answering their front door, with a person in an uniform on the other side.
                The homeowner has a dismayed expression on their face, and the person in the uniform is saying: "I just
                respond to what the system tells me, and the system is saying you're too loud."
