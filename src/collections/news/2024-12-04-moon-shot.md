In 1962, U.S. President Kennedy made a famous speech where he promoted the idea
of putting a human on the moon by the end of the decade. This was very ambitious
and, to some, highly unlikely given the state of space technology and
exploration at the time. However, progress was made over the following years
and the goal was achieved in 1969 with the Apollo 11 Moon landing.

It was called a "moonshot", where the term originally meant, literally, to
develop a rocket system capable of going to the moon, landing there, and then
returning to Earth safely. The objective was monumental for the time, and the
term gained a figurative meaning, that of any attempt to achieve a lofty and
unlikely goal. The Bliss symbols at the top of this article show this
difference. When asked to express "moonshot" using Bliss, the author came up
with the literal "rocket landing on the moon" symbols on the left. A more
experienced Bliss "speaker" offered "huge metaphor goal" as the meaning in
Bliss.

Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained using massive amounts of textual data
taken from books, articles, web content, and so on. All of this text is human
generated and represents a corpus of linguistic expressions in a natural
language. Natural languages come from speech, a vocalization of sequences of
words; that is, most natural languages are based on <em>phonetics</em>. Written
language, or orthography, is a character-graphic based representation of the
phonetics. As a consequence, LLMs are models of phonetic based languages.

Blissymbolics is a meaning-graphic form of language. Charles Bliss, its
creator, called this kind of writing "semantography" or "meaning-writing".
Bliss is not spoken and has no phonology. With respect to LLMs, it is an
outlier and at best is not represented well within an LLM. At worst, it is not
represented at all. Nonetheless, like written forms of natural languages, it is
a productive linguistic system in that many thoughts and ideas can be expressed
in a sentential manner based on the [fundamental rules](https://www.blissymbolics.org/images/bliss-rules.pdf) of Bliss symbol
composition.

One of the latest goals of the [Baby Bliss Bot](https://floeproject.org/baby-bliss-bot-project/)
project is to extend and expand the capabilities of phonetic-based LLMs to
handle meaning-based symbol systems like Blissymbolics. Another aspect of the
1960s moonshot was the positive side effects from the technologies that were
developed. They proved useful beyond the field of space exploration and
beneficial to society. The hope is that stretching the capabilities of LLMs with
a minority symbol system will have similar unforeseen but advantageous side
effects. The research opens up new possibilities to adapt LLMs to other
symbol-based communication systems, such as [Picture Communication Symbols](https://us.tobiidynavox.com/products/picture-communication-symbols-pcs),
[SymbolStix](https://www.n2y.com/symbolstix-prime/) and [Widget Symbols](https://www.widgit.com/),
and to other minority languages. These systems usually have smaller amounts of
data available, presenting a challenge for using them with LLMs. The project's
approach will provide a way to extend and stretch language models in these
low-resource areas, making communication more accessible and supportive for a
wider range of users.
