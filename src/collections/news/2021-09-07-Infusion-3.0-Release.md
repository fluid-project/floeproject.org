The FLOE team is pleased to announce the release of Infusion 3.0!

A lot of time and effort has gone into this release, and weâ€™d like to thank everyone in the community for their contributions.

Infusion 3.0 includes many changes to the core and preferences framework and may not be backwards compatible with
previous versions of Infusion. All bundled JS files are now minified, so you may need to update your imports if you
were specifically requesting minified versions for previous releases.

Please see [API Changes from 2.0 to 3.0](https://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/APIChangesFrom2_0To3_0) and
[Deprecations in 3.0](https://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/DeprecatedIn3_0) on the
[Infusion Documentation](https://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/) site.
