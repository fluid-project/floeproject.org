Through work on the [Partnerships for Financial Inclusion](https://idrc.ocadu.ca/projects/financial-inclusion/) project, the IDRC is creating an openly available Guidebook for Financial Inclusion. This guidebook will offer a window into the experiences of people who face barriers when interacting with financial systems and when trying to access the resources they need for stability. It will contain tools to help financial institutions expand their understanding of potential clients—especially those often overlooked when financial products and services are designed. The narratives help build empathy and broaden perspective, while the frameworks support assessment and planning. Each tool can be used on its own or in combination, depending on the institution’s needs and goals.
