title: Community Led Co-design Kit

excerpt: Using co-design to improve the content and features of the co-design kit.

---

Over the past year, several rounds of co-design have been held to get feedback on the kit,
its resources, and how it can improve learning outcomes for its users. Using the feedback,
the team has updated the website, information architecture, and added a search function.
We are also in the process of updating the kit content based on both the feedback and what
we’ve learned about the community-led co-design practice over the years.

A larger community of practitioners outside of the IDRC have started to contribute to
the kit. A collaborator at the University of Toronto has used the kit in a study of design
toolkits in the broader design research space. The feedback gleaned from this has led
to the creation of more case study content, which is currently being published on the site.
