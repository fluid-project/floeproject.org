At the [ISTE19 conference](https://web.archive.org/web/20200922142718/https://conference.iste.org/2019/), we shared a [coding environment prototype](https://prototype.codelearncreate.org/)
with educators interested in teaching coding skills to students who are currently left out. We also gave a
presentation entitled
[Coding for All: Instruction That Includes Students With Special Needs](https://web.archive.org/web/20220127194104/https://conference.iste.org/2019/program/search/detail_session.php?id=112083158).

This summer, the project particpated in coding camps at [Kayla's Children Centre](https://codelearncreate.ca/blog/co-design-session-1/)
and [Playful Strides](https://codelearncreate.ca/blog/co-design-session-4/) where the prototype was used by students to
create artworks. Campers spent some of the day considering how to redesign the prototype and their insight is being used
to update this prototype and to create new ones.
