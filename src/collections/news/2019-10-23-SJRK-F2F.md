On <time datetime="2019-10-17">October 17th</time>, the [Social Justice Repair Kit](https://www.sojustrepairit.org/)
project met to reflect on the past three years of work. Participants created [stories](http://stories.sojustrepairit.org/)
to capture their experiences on the project. Highlights included training youth to lead environmental protection work
and doing audio-visual workshops with youth at the margins, enabling them to not only tell their stories but also to
capture and present them in ways they want to.

At the end of the day, the project team created a collaborative surprise drawing which represents
the creative collaborations that happened throughout the project.
