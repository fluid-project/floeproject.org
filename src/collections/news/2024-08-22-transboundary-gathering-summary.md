## Summary

The **Transboundary Gathering: Digital Ecocultural Mapping in the Salish Sea** was an Indigenous-led collaborative
working meeting and coalition-building event that took place in August 2023 on the ancestral land of the Indigenous
Lummi people in Washington State. This 5-day gathering took place under the leadership of Kusemaat (Shirley Williams)
and [Whiteswan Environmental](https://www.whiteswanenvironmental.org/), who are located in Lummi territory, Washington
State, with the support of the [American Indian Higher Education Consortium (AIHEC)](https://www.aihec.org/),
[Western Washingon University’s Centre for Community Learning](https://ccl.wwu.edu/), the
[Institute for Multidisciplinary Ecological Research in the Salish Sea (IMERSS)](https://imerss.org/)
and [OCAD University’s Inclusive Design Research Centre (IDRC)](https://idrc.ocadu.ca/). The gathering brought
together over 100 Indigenous and non-Indigenous researchers, designers, students, and government officials
from Canada and the U.S. to consider approaches to ecocultural mapping that are rooted in the land, respect
cultural safety, address issues of data sovereignty, protect sacred knowledge, and ensure Indigenous leadership.

The gathering included structured conversation and discussion through facilitated social learning circles and
community-led design sessions, singing, storytelling, tours of the land and site visits. Participants engaged
in activities at multiple locations including two ancestral village sites and the Lummi reservation. Visiting
locations central to the present-day lives and rich ecocultural heritage of the Lummi people helped to facilitate a
deeper understanding of the impact, benefit and challenges of ecocultural mapping in this region and beyond.

## Ecocultural Mapping

The impetus for this gathering was
[an interdisciplinary, participatory and inclusive digital mapping project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0v84S7DeORU)
that began in 2020. Digital ecocultural mapping can provide visualizations and storytelling about natural, cultural,
and historical sites including ancestral village sites, camps, reef net locations, food sovereignty, biodiversity and
Indigenous stewardship systems. ​The
[pilot project of the ecocultural story map](https://imerss.github.io/xetthecum-storymap-story/Xetthecum-Storymap-Reknitted.html#)
aims to meaningfully braid together Indigenous ways of knowing and ecological science to create an interactive,
educational, ecocultural map of a region in the Salish Sea called Xetthecum in the Hul’q’umi’num’ language
(Retreat Cove, Galiano Island, BC).

    menu showing "The Story of Xetthecum", "About", "Explore" and "Resources". On the upper half of the page there
    is a zoomed-in map of a small area of Galiano Island showing several different regions represented by
    different colours and symbolic tiles. The map legend lists Forests, Freshwater, Marine and Woodlands.
    Text appears in a 2-column box in the bottom half of the page with the heading "Xetthecum".'>

This digital ecocultural storymap and [accompanying website](https://imerss.github.io/xetthecum-storymap/)
will serve as an educational resource supporting Indigenous youth and others to learn the Hul’q’umi’num’ language,
study the regional biodiversity and ecological communities in which different species live, and learn about the
ecological and cultural values of those species and communities. The storymap also aims to promote ecocultural mapping
as a professional conservation practice among the next generation of land stewards. The Transboundary Gathering
provided an opportunity for the coalition, together with a broader audience, to co-create next steps for a broader
mapping initiative that would include the
[mapping of Pe’pi’ow’elh](https://imerss.github.io/imerss-bioinfo/Pe%27pi%27ow%27elh.html)
(English Camp) in Lummi territory.

## Relationship Building and Knowledge Sharing

The starting point for this digital ecocultural mapping project was the preservation of biodiversity in the Salish Sea,
a region that spans the colonially-imposed boundary between Canada and the US (Sobocinski 2021). Transboundary
relationships are essential for the success of this work; the colonial fragmentation of Indigenous tribes caused
by enforcement of the Canada-US border has created a barrier to the knowledge sharing and collaborative
solution-building essential to restoring Indigenous language, culture and lands (Norman 2012; Wilson 2019).

The Transboundary Gathering acted as a catalyst for establishing an on-going collaborative partnership to support
cross-cultural ecocultural mapping efforts in the Salish Sea region, and to share tools and resources that will
support similar efforts elsewhere. Together with Indigenous and non-Indigenous designers, scholars and technologists,
we explored the implications of co-design and interdisciplinary knowledge exchange among Indigenous communities,
bioscientists, ecologists, and inclusive designers. Building on the development of community-led co-design methods,
the gathering provided an opportunity for workshop participants to extend and apply these practices to address
the challenges of cross-cultural collaboration and to consider how an inclusive design approach can help to
reconceptualize the design of technologies and cultural systems in ways that centre Indigenous leadership and
epistemology.
