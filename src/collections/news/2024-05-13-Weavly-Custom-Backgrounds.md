title: Custom Backgrounds in Weavly
date: "2024-05-13"
excerpt: Try the new feature in the Weavly coding environment and create your custom background.

---

Over the past few years, the Weavly team has consistently heard from learners and educators
that they want the ability to build their own backgrounds in the
[Weavly coding environment](https://create.weavly.org).
In the summer of 2023, we created a prototype and worked with kids to
[co-design the custom background feature](https://codelearncreate.org/blog/custom-backgrounds-codesign/).

You can now modify an existing background or create a new background using many different
coloured tiles along with gems, gold and treats. There is also a special wall tile that
will stop the character from moving.

Watch the video below to find out how to use this feature.
<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
