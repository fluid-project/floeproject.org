excerpt: A Transboundary Gathering - Digital Ecocultural Mapping in the Salish Sea
---
The Floe team is co-organizing an Indigenous-led collaborative working meeting and
coalition-building event with
[Whiteswan Environmental](https://www.whiteswanenvironmental.org/) (WE), the
[American Indian Higher Education Consortium](https://www.aihec.org/) (AIHEC) and the
[Institute for Multidisciplinary Ecological Research in the Salish Sea](https://imerss.org/)
(IMERSS). The gathering will bring together Indigenous and non-Indigenous researchers, 
designers, students, and government officials from Canada and the U.S. to consider
approaches to ecocultural mapping that respect cultural safety, address issues of data
sovereignty, protect sacred knowledge, and ensure Indigenous leadership.

The [Digital ecocultural mapping tool](https://floeproject.org/ecocultural-mapping-project/)
provides visualizations and storytelling about the natural, cultural, and historical
significance of local ecological communities through the incorporation of biodiversity
data, Indigenous language learning, art and other multi-media content. â€‹Taking place on
the ancestral land of the Indigenous Lummi people, the Transboundary Gathering will act
as a catalyst for establishing an on-going collaborative partnership to support
cross-cultural ecocultural mapping efforts in the Salish Sea region, and to share tools
and resources that will support similar efforts elsewhere.

Participants will critically examine how an inclusive design approach can help to
reconceptualize the design of technologies and cultural systems in ways that centre
Indigenous leadership and epistemology. Together with Indigenous and non-Indigenous
designers, scholars and technologists, we will undertake collaborative research, exploring
the implications of co-design and interdisciplinary knowledge exchange among Indigenous
communities, bioscientists, ecologists, and inclusive designers. Building on the development
of community-led co-design methods, the gathering will provide an opportunity for workshop
participants to critique, extend, and apply these practices to address the challenges of
cross-cultural collaboration.
