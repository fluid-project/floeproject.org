excerpt: Developing new curriculum supports through intergenerational coding workshops using Weavly.

From October through December 2022, the Floe project is working with the
[GrandPals](https://grandpals.ca/) project and the
[By Design Learning Centre](https://www.bydesignlearning.ca/) to approach
intergenerational activities from a different perspective: Coding!
Through this partnership, we are exploring how coding can enrich interactions between
different generations and encourage them to share stories and exchange life experiences.

We are running a series of 5 co-design workshops with a group of senior adults and
grade 2 & 3 students. To start, our co-designers learned a little about coding and
how to use the [Weavly coding environment](https://create.weavly.org).
Now they are creating coding activities that can foster intergenerational conversations
and storytelling. With these activities, people from different age groups can work
together to learn about coding as they share life experiences. These activities will
be publicly available in the
[Weavly Educator's Toolkit](https://weavly.org/learn/activities/) in early 2023.
