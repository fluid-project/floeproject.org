FLOE is participating in the 2021 worldwide [Hour of Code](https://hourofcode.com) event which
introduces and demystifies computer science through short engaging activities. The
[three activities](https://hourofcode.com/weavly) that have been included use the
[Weavly](https://weavly.org/) coding environment with space, undersea and savanna themes.

The Hour of Code initiative gathers coding related activities from many sources however, most
leave out people using assistive technologies. The FLOE activities were co-designed with
kids with complex disabilities ensuring they work well for a diversity of needs.
