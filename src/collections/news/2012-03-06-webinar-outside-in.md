Jutta Treviranus, Director of the Inclusive Design Research Centre at OCAD University,
will be co-presenting a webinar as part of
[Open Education Week](http://www.openeducationweek.org/).
The aim of Open Education Week is to raise awareness of the open education movement
and its impact on teaching and learning worldwide. The webinar, entitled "Outside
In - Achieving Our Goals by Designing for Diversity," will discuss how processes
that design open courseware resources and delivery platforms for diverse learners
also address many other goals, including deeper learning, delivery on mobile
platforms, discovery, internationalization, and many more.

The webinar will be presented Thursday, March 8, 2012 at 22:00 GMT.
