    Web of Strings.

The activities described in the [Inclusive Design Guide](https://guide.inclusivedesign.ca/) cover a range of needs from
collaborative “ice-breakers” to more comprehensive design activities, all of which can be used by any group to learn
about and reflect on the practice of inclusive design in a particular context. Several activities have recently been
added to the Guide including the [Collaborative Art Warmup](https://guide.inclusivedesign.ca/activities/collaborative-art-warmup/)
,[Functional Mashup](https://guide.inclusivedesign.ca/activities/functional-mashup/),
[Virtuous Tornado](https://guide.inclusivedesign.ca/activities/virtuous-tornado/), and
[Web of Strings](https://guide.inclusivedesign.ca/activities/web-of-strings/). We invite you to give them a try!

In addition, [Creating Inclusive Learning Experiences](https://handbook.floeproject.org/approaches/create-inclusive-learning-experiences/)
is a new entry to the [Inclusive Learning Design Handbook](https://handbook.floeproject.org/). This entry describes ways
of addressing and embracing learning differences in both formal and informal education, with a focus on cultivating
learners’ self-knowledge and encouraging self-reflection throughout the learning process.

As we practice and learn more about inclusive design we will continue to develop our ideas and add new content to our
inclusive design resources. These resources continue to grow and evolve along with our thinking, and we welcome your
feedback.

## Coming Soon

Watch for new entries about Create-a-Thons in both the Inclusive Design Guide and the Inclusive Learning Design
Handbook, as well as a restructuring of the Handbook that will improve navigation and findability of content.
