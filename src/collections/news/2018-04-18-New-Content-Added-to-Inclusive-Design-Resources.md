The activities described in the
[Inclusive Design Guide](https://guide.inclusivedesign.ca/index.html) cover a range of needs from collaborative “ice-breakers”
to more comprehensive design activities, all of which can be used by any group to learn about and
reflect on the practice of inclusive design in a particular context. Several activities
have recently been added to the Guide including the [Collaborative Art Warmup](https://guide.inclusivedesign.ca/activities/CollaborativeArtWarmup.html)
,[Functional Mashup](https://guide.inclusivedesign.ca/activities/FunctionalMashup.html),
[Virtuous Tornado](https://guide.inclusivedesign.ca/activities/VirtuousTornado.html), and
[Web of Strings](https://guide.inclusivedesign.ca/activities/WebOfStrings.html). We invite you to give them a try!

In addition, [Creating Inclusive Learning Experiences](https://handbook.floeproject.org/CreatingInclusiveLearningExperiences.html)
is a new entry to the [Inclusive Learning Design Handbook](https://handbook.floeproject.org/index.html).
This entry describes ways of addressing and embracing learning differences in both formal and informal
education, with a focus on cultivating learners’ self-knowledge and encouraging self-reflection throughout
the learning process.

As we practice and learn more about inclusive design we will continue to develop our ideas and
add new content to our inclusive design resources. These resources continue to grow and evolve
along with our thinking, and we welcome your feedback.

#### Coming Soon

Watch for new entries about Create-a-Thons in both the Inclusive Design Guide and the Inclusive
Learning Design Handbook, as well as a restructuring of the Handbook that will improve navigation
and findability of content.
