title: Self-Assessment Learning Toolkit

We have been working on the design and implementation of an inclusive self-assessment
toolkit that will engage learners themselves – supported by personalized learning
analytics – as aspiring research scientists in the important subject of self-regulation
and self-determination. The toolkit will engage a broad spectrum of learners in a
self-directed, personalized learning process, by enabling learners to set flexible
goals and customizable milestones towards achieving those goals based on their unique needs and preferences.

Recently, the design team has been considering alternate entry points into the toolkit,
from highly specific to broad and exploratory. Part of this work has been the exploration
of new ways of engaging the learner through customizable “touchnotes”, which would afford
the learner a quick and easy manual data collection process. A single data point is
collected when a touchnote is selected. This can be combined with inputs from automated
data collection sources (e.g. from a weather app or a personal health app, etc.),
resulting in a fully personalizable data analysis and self-assessment.

The following images show examples of the designs we are currently developing

Figure 1. A learner can choose to be prompted for more detailed information when they
select a touchnote in their personalized collection.
</summary>
The image shows a collection of square 'touchnotes' buttons on the left with the heading
'Query: When do I feel most clear-headed and focused?'. The touchnotes in the collection
include 'Focused', 'Good Idea', 'Meditation', 'Weather', 'Diet', and 'Sleep'.
An arrow points from the 'Sleep' touchnote to a dialog box with prompts for more information
including 'Time to bed', 'How many hours?', 'Woke up feeling: refreshed/tired', 'Disrupted?
Y/N', and an option to add notes to a journal. There is a save button at the bottom
of the dialog box.

Figure 2. Data collected through touch-notes and automated tracking (e.g. weather) is presented
back to the learner in a personalized format.
</summary>
The image shows a column of touchnotes on the left-hand side, some of which have been dragged
into a data analysis area in the middle of the screen, where there is a plot showing 4 horizontal
and synchronous 'tracks' of touchnote data vs. time. The plot is titled 'Analysis: What is
causing my headaches?'. The data plotted in the analysis includes 'Weather', 'Coffee', 'Dairy'
, and 'Headaches'.

self-assessment toolkit. Choices made on this screen will help to guide the learner in setting
up their data collection process, including touchnotes.
</summary>
The image shows a mobile interface screen with text that states 'Begin by keeping track of one
or more of the following:'. This text is followed by a list of checkboxes including: 'Where you
go (Places)', 'What you eat (Food), 'What you do (Activities)', and 'How you feel (Mood)'.
This list is followed by an option to 'Show me what others have done', with 'Next' and 'Go back'
buttons at the bottom of the screen.
