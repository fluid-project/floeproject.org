The Platform Cooperative Development Kit project engaged in a number of co-design activities with
cooperative members-owners, and created the [Resource Library](https://resources.platform.coop/)
to share information about platform coops.

Another resource, the Tool Library, is the result of designing with cooperatives a way to enable
knowledge sharing and tools for running their co-operatives. The Library is expected to go live
in the coming weeks.

The project also created [Pinecone](https://pinecone.netlify.app/), an open, reusable,
and accessible web component library for helping rapidly create websites.
