[Lumen Learning](http://lumenlearning.com/) has been selected to receive funding as part of the
[Next Generation Courseware Challenge](https://www.gatesfoundation.org/Media-Center/Press-Releases/2014/09/Gates-Foundation-Announces-Finalists-for-$20-Million-in-Digital-Courseware-Investments),
a $20 million grant competition from the [Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation](http://www.gatesfoundation.org/)
to build exemplary, affordable digital course materials that improve student success among low-income
and disadvantaged learners. Inspired in part by the groundbreaking work of Benjamin Bloom, Lumen’s
courseware will apply educational strategies that show promise for improving learning outcomes: personal
learning pathways for developing subject mastery; personalized teaching; and effective use of open
educational resources. The result will be “next generation” courseware for four introductory-level
college courses that enroll millions of students every year: Introduction to Business; Principles of
Marketing; Microeconomics; and Macroeconomics..

The Floe team is excited to be a partner in this project. Floe will design the courseware’s universally
accessible user experience through a highly iterative, inclusive and learner-centric process.
The courseware developed through this grant will pioneer a new model for digital courseware and
delivery tailored to the needs of disadvantaged students.
