We Count is [gathering challenges](https://wecount.inclusivedesign.ca/inclusion-challenges/)
faced by the community related to data ecosystem inclusion.

In two co-creation activities, We Count engaged diverse perspectives to consider
the needs and requirements for a more equitable Smart City. Stories were co-created
to uncover and explain challenges, needs, benefits and potential dangers of data-driven
communities. The [resulting reports](https://wecount.inclusivedesign.ca/views/journeys-through-the-digital-innovation-appendix-of-the-master-innovation-and-development-plan/)
are openly available.

An illustrator provided a visual representation of these stories, specifically what can
happen when decisions are based on audio sensor data that can’t recognize uncontrollable
noises such as involuntary vocalizations.

The homeowner has a dismayed expression on their face, and the person in the uniform
is saying: "I just respond to what the system tells me, and the system is saying you're
too loud."
