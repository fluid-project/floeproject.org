The Coding to Learn project team has [created a co-design kit](https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/C2LC/Coding+to+Learn+and+Create+Co-Design+Kit)
aimed at engaging kids with complex disabilities in coding skills and education is being created.
The growing collection of activities includes multi-modal collaborative art creation.

Since the COVID-19 isolation period, the team has explored remote coding and creativity
workshops. Working with teachers, parents and students with complex disabilities, the team
is developing a set of activities and processes to engage students remotely. These new
insights will be added to the co-design kit in the coming weeks.

[The Inclusive Coding Environment](https://build.codelearncreate.org/) is being
developed through a collaborative co-design process, currently including remote co-design coding sessions.

An [Educator’s Toolkit](https://resources.codelearncreate.org/) has been created
to provide teachers with resources for teaching coding to diverse students. The toolkit
will be redesigned and new resources will be added in the coming year.
