The Floe team has been involved in a number of activities recently:

We have been collaborating with [OER Commons](http://www.oercommons.org/) in several areas:

- Helping to ensure that OER Commons is accessible to all learners and educators,
- integrating the Infusion
  [User Interface Options component](http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/%28Floe%29+User+Interface+Options+%28aka.+Learner+Options%29)
  into OER Commons, and
- contributing to the design and development of [Open Author](http://www.oercommons.org/open-author-about).

Our development team is also working on a [fully accessible, open source HTML5 video player](http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/%28Floe%29%20video%20player%20mockups%20%28final%29).
You can try the [demo](https://build.fluidproject.org/videoPlayer/demos/Mammals.html).
