Floe is working with the
[Coding to Learn and Create project](https://codelearncreate.ca/)
to design educational coding tools for kids who've been left out of learning,
and to create Open Educational Resources (OER) including activities, lessons,
and projects that help kids learn, develop social and communication skills,
and express themselves with code.

We've created a [coding prototype](https://prototype.codelearncreate.org/)
for learners to try out. The prototype works with robots that are currently
being used in classrooms to teach programming skills.
