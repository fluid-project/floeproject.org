                    <p class="floe-date">November 30, 2016</p>
                    <p>
                        On October 13-14, 2016 the <a href="http://deep.idrc.ocadu.ca">DEEP - Discovery conference</a> brought together an international community of over 100 diverse participants to discuss timely, difficult, and engaging topics.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This year’s theme was: “Our Data: Who owns it, who controls it, what can we do with it?”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        DEEP 2016 welcomed the participation of four initiatives that each brought essential perspectives to the agenda, namely: international collaboration, platforms for inclusive prosperity, privacy, and life-long learning. The EU project Discovery, the SSHRC supported TIPP consortium, the Office of the Privacy Commissioner supported project on privacy and inclusion, and several open education projects all participated in DEEP 2016. Participation from each of these projects helps to ensure that conversations and plans will be acted upon and the work started at DEEP will continue well beyond the conference.

                    <p class="floe-date">Nov. 16, 2015</p>
                    <p>Floe is working with <a href="http://phet.colorado.edu/">PhET</a>
                        to improve the accessibility of their free, open, interactive physics simulations. Over the past
                        year, we have contributed research, ideas, and evaluations for improvements to two of PhET's simulations:
                        <a href="https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/PhET+Forces+and+Motion+Simulation+Design">Forces and Motion Basics</a> and

                    <p>
                        The PhET team has been working to incorporate our input into a development version of the
                        <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/physics/phet/dev/html/forces-and-motion-basics/1.1.5-accessible-instance.3/forces-and-motion-basics_en.html?accessibility&screens=1">Forces and Motion: Basics</a>
                        simulation, and is now conducting user tests. Implementation of the new designs for the John Travoltage simulation is planned for December 2015.

                        From this collaboration with PhET, a guide "<a href="http://handbook.floeproject.org/WebGamesAndSimulations.html">Web Games and Simulations</a>" has been added to the <a href="http://handbook.floeproject.org/">Inclusive Learning Design Handbook</a> to help educators create more inclusive and accessible web games and educational simulations.

                    <p class="floe-date">May 8, 2015</p>
                    <p>The <a href="http://www.viscardicenter.org/services/nbdc/">National Business and
                        Disability Council (NBDC)</a> at <a href="http://www.viscardicenter.org/">The Viscardi Center</a>
                         is offering an educational online workshop to focus on designing for diversity.</p>
                    <p>No one needs to point out that the current business climate is in a state of flux
                        and transformation. To thrive requires a good measure of agility, responsiveness,
                        continuous innovation and dynamic resiliency. These qualities are the by-products of
                        broadly diverse perspectives, skills, and approaches combined with the conditions
                        that foster their inclusion. Fortuitously, emerging technologies and associated
                        practices make it viable to move beyond mass design – in policy, communication,
                        product development, service, marketing, training and other business practices –
                        and make special the norm. If we proactively design for diversity we not only comply
                        with legislative requirements for accessibility but we also reap the benefits of
                        flexibility, adaptability and a spectrum of possible approaches, to thrive in a
                        quickly evolving business climate.</p>
                        <ul>

                    <p class="floe-date">September 30, 2014</p>
                    <p><a href="http://lumenlearning.com/">Lumen Learning</a> has been selected to receive funding as part of the
                        <a href="http://www.gatesfoundation.org/Media-Center/Press-Releases">Next Generation Courseware Challenge</a>,
                        a $20 million grant competition from the <a href="http://www.gatesfoundation.org/">Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation</a>
                        to build exemplary, affordable digital course materials that improve student success among low-income
                        and disadvantaged learners. Inspired in part by the groundbreaking work of Benjamin Bloom, Lumen’s
                        courseware will apply educational strategies that show promise for improving learning outcomes: personal
                        learning pathways for developing subject mastery; personalized teaching; and effective use of open
                        educational resources. The result will be “next generation” courseware for four introductory-level
                        college courses that enroll millions of students every year: Introduction to Business; Principles of
                        Marketing; Microeconomics; and Macroeconomics.</p>
                    <p>The Floe team is excited to be a partner in this project. Floe will design the courseware’s universally
                        accessible user experience through a highly iterative, inclusive and learner-centric process.
                        The courseware developed through this grant will pioneer a new model for digital courseware and
                        delivery tailored to the needs of disadvantaged students.</p>

                    <p class="floe-date">April 21, 2014</p>
                    <p>The Floe team recently contributed to the development of a set of accessibility
                        metadata properties that were adopted by <a href="http://schema.org/">Schema.org</a>,
                        a consortium of major search engines including Bing, Google, Yahoo! and Yandex.
                        The properties are based on the IMS Global Learning Consortium's <a href="http://www.imsglobal.org/accessibility">Access For All specification</a>.
                    These additions will make it easier for publishers and webmasters to connect learners
                    with the most useful content, and help users with special needs locate and consume
                    content that is most appropriate for their specific needs.
                    </p>
                    <p>The Floe team is working on <a href="http://wiki.fluidproject.org/download/attachments/37855787/metadata-search.pdf?api=v2">designs for a search interface</a> that would filter content based on these properties.

                    <p>The Floe team is developing a suite of tools for creating more accessible and
                        personalizable web content by supporting the creation of accessibility metadata.
                        These tools will allow content creators to easily generate metadata at the point of creation,
                        reducing the cost and complexity of pro-ducing and delivering content that can be tailored to a user’s needs and preferences.</p>

                        Learning and education are the enablers of social and economic change. E-learning
                        systems allow instructors and students to interact synchronously and asynchronously
                        from any part of the world that has a viable internet connection. This symposium will
                        explore the relationship between content accessibility and interface accessibility,
                        accessibility of e-learning environments used in non-conventional contexts,
                        privacy issues in profiling learners and e-learning environments users, and other important topics.
