                    <p class="floe-date">April 21, 2014</p>
                    <p>The Floe team recently contributed to the development of a set of accessibility
                        metadata properties that were adopted by <a href="http://schema.org/">Schema.org</a>,
                        a consortium of major search engines including Bing, Google, Yahoo! and Yandex.
                        The properties are based on the IMS Global Learning Consortium's <a href="http://www.imsglobal.org/accessibility">Access For All specification</a>.
                    These additions will make it easier for publishers and webmasters to connect learners
                    with the most useful content, and help users with special needs locate and consume
                    content that is most appropriate for their specific needs. 
                    </p>
                    <p>The Floe team is working on <a href="http://wiki.fluidproject.org/download/attachments/37855787/metadata-search.pdf?api=v2">designs for a search interface</a> which would filter content based on these properties.

                    <p class="floe-date">March 18, 2014</p>
                    <p>The Floe team is developing a suite of tools for creating more accessible and
                        personalizable web content by supporting the creation of accessibility metadata.
                        These tools will allow content creators to easily generate metadata at the point of creation,
                        reducing the cost and complexity of pro-ducing and delivering content that can be tailored to a user’s needs and preferences.</p>

                        of the latest work illustrates the metadata that can be automatically generated during the process of adding a video to an OER. By building tools that focus on content creation at the point of authoring, Floe prioritizes accessibility metadata while providing built-in solutions suitable for any content authoring system.</p>

                        W3C's Web Accessibility Initiative will be hosting an Accessible E-Learning
                        online symposium on December 16, 2013. They are currently inviting submission of
                        new research, ongoing research, and analysis of past research related to e-learning accessibility.

                        Learning and education are the enablers of social and economic change. E-learning
                        systems allow instructors and students to interact synchronously and asynchronously
                        from any part of the world that has a viable internet connection. This symposium will
                        explore the relationship between content accessibility and interface accessibility,
                        accessibility of e-learning environments used in non-conventional contexts,
                        privacy issues in profiling learners and e-learning environments users, and other important topics.
