                    <p class="floe-date">November 05, 2013</p>
                    <p>
                        W3C's Web Accessibility Initiative will be hosting an Accessible E-Learning online symposium on December 16, 2013. They are currently inviting submission of new research, ongoing research, and analysis of past research related to e-learning accessibility.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Learning and education are the enablers of social and economic change. E-learning systems allow instructors and students to interact synchronously and asynchronously from any part of the world that has a viable internet connection. This symposium will explore the relationship between content accessibility and interface accessibility, accessibility of e-learning environments used in non-conventional contexts, privacy issues in profiling learners and e-learning environments users, and other important topics.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Participation in the symposium is free.
